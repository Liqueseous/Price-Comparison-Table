//Built using ReactJS Library version 16.0.0
//
//I decided to use ReactJS for this assignment because I wanted to learn 
//it and get some hands on experience with it. A lot of Javascript development
//in the field is switching to React and I felt like I should learn it for
//a better start out in the job world. Along with becoming a new industry standard
//React is a very powerful library that make it easy to make some very powerful sites.
//React is also very friendly with other libraries and frameworks, It is all around useful.
