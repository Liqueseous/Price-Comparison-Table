//Built using ReactJS Library version 16.0.0
//
//I decided to use ReactJS for this assignment because I wanted to learn 
//it and get some hands on experience with it. A lot of Javascript development
//in the field is switching to React and I felt like I should learn it for
//a better start out in the job world. Along with becoming a new industry standard
//React is a very powerful library that make it easy to make some very powerful sites.
//React is also very friendly with other libraries and frameworks, It is all around useful.

//This is the first component to be rendered from here we get passed to our router which will then decide where we should be.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Routes from './routes';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

//import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
//import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';

//picks our style sheet and sends us to our router which will decide where we should be
ReactDOM.render((
	<Router>
		<Routes />
	</Router>
	), document.getElementById('root'));
